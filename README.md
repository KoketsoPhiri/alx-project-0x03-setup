# üöÄ Splash App: Next.js Boilerplate with Shared Layout & Routing

Welcome to **Splash App**, a foundational Next.js project designed as a boilerplate for building modern web applications. This project focuses on implementing core features such as a shared layout, global styling with Google Fonts, imperative routing, and a well-organized codebase with centralized interfaces.

This repository serves as the setup for `alx-project-0x03`, demonstrating best practices for structuring a Next.js application using the **App Router**.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Shared Layout (DRY Principle):** Implements a reusable `Layout` component that wraps all pages, providing a consistent `Header` and `Footer` across the application, adhering to the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle.
* **Reusable Button Component:** A highly customizable `Button` component with support for different sizes, background colors, and action handlers.
* **Google Fonts Integration:** Globally imports and applies the "Montserrat" font from Google Fonts using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a consistent and appealing typography throughout the application.
* **Imperative Routing:** Demonstrates programmatically navigating between pages using the `useRouter` hook from `next/navigation`, particularly useful for navigation triggered by user interactions (e.g., button clicks).
* **Centralized Interfaces:** All TypeScript interfaces (`ButtonProps`, `LayoutProps`, `PageRouteProps`) are consolidated into a single `interface/index.ts` file, promoting better code organization and maintainability.
* **Custom 404 Page:** A custom and user-friendly "Page Not Found" (`404`) error page (`app/not-found.tsx`) to enhance the user experience for non-existent routes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Next.js 14+ (App Router):** A React framework for production-ready applications.
* **React 18+:** The core JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **TypeScript:** A strongly typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer experience.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
* **React Icons (`react-icons/fa`):** A library for including popular icon packs in your React projects.
